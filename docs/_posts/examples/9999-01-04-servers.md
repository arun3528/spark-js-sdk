The [Getting Started](/example/getting-started) guide will get you pretty far in node land, but at some point, you'll probably want more users than just yourself.

> This guide and the corresponding code is still a work in progress. While every effort will be made to avoid breaking changes, expect some fluctuation around the initialization and authorization apis.

Before you can login users with OAuth, you'll need to register a new application on the [developer portal](https://developer.ciscospark.com). You'll need to set some of the values from that page as environment variables:
- `CISCOSPARK_CLIENT_ID`
- `CISCOSPARK_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `CISCOSPARK_REDIRECT_URI`
- `CISCOSPARK_SCOPE`

# Init

Use `ciscospark.init()` to create new `CiscoSpark` instance.

```javascript
var ciscospark = require('ciscospark');
const spark2 = ciscospark.init();
```

Use the authorization url you got from the developer portal to authenticate your users and get back an auth code. Then, pass that auth code to spark

```javascript
spark2.authorize({code: <code>})
  .then(function() {
    // spark is authorized
  });
```

By default, `ciscospark` stores credentials and some other registration data in memory, but we provide a generic interface - inspired by [leveldb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leveldb) - for hooking in your own cache layer. See [Storage Layer]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 9999-03-01-storage-layer %}) for more details.

# Express Example

The following is an approximation of how an expressjs app might do authentication. It assumes you're using a session middleware of some kind that puts a user identifier on each request. The function `storageAdapterForYourBackend` would produce a storage adapter bound to the user specified in the request object.

## OAuth Route Handlers

```javascript
const ciscospark = require(`ciscospark`);
const assert = require(`assert`);

app.get(`/login`, (req, res) => {
  res.redirect(ciscospark.credentials.buildOAuthUrl()).end();
});

app.get(`/oauth/redirect`, (req, res) => {
  assert(req.params.code);
  req.spark = ciscospark.init({
    config: {
      storage: {
        boundedAdapter: storageAdapterForYourBackend(req)
      }
    }
  });

  req.spark.authorize(req.params)
    .then(() => {

      res.redirect(`/`).end();
    });
});
```

## Auth Middleware
```javascript
const ciscospark = require(`ciscospark`);
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user) {
    req.spark = ciscospark.init({
      config: {
        storage: {
          boundedAdapter: storageAdapterForYourBackend(req)
        }
      }
    });
  }

  next();
});
```
